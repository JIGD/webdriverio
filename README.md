# webdriverio

## In order to run: 
* Download this project
* Install latest stable node
* Using command line on the project directory run npm install command
* Using command line project directory type ./node_modules/.bin/selenium-standalone install
* Add selenium to path variable
* Using command line project directory type ./node_modules/.bin/selenium-standalone start
* Using command line on the project directory type npm test

##Blockers:
* Had an issue with selenium where it would fail on install.
* Had an issue with how webdriver.io manages elements and promises since it's really different to how it's done on protractor.
* Had an issue with cucumber finds step definitions (Had to switch to jasmine).
